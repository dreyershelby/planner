comment EVERYTHING & finish the calendar!

- add preambles or whatever theyre called to every document, like the
  comments u see first thing and that are for the whole document
  - put the written dependencies in the preambles
- instead of creating new objects that may already exist from the last
  time the script was run, select these objects by name
  - used every time an object is created
- make all const names CAPITALIZED
- finish the calendar
  - create calendar object style
